Contributing to pyrax
=====================

Please create all pull requests against the 'working' branch. The 'master'
branch is reserved for full releases, complete with updated docs, etc.

While PEP8 is generally followed, it is not treated as Holy Gospel. Practicality
beats purity, and coming up with some convoluted coding to avoid a line of 82
characters is an anti-pattern.

When indenting continuation lines, the standard is 2 levels (i.e., 8 spaces).
Please do not use "visual indentation", as it is fraught with its own
issues with consistency.

All changes other than simple typos should be accompanied by unit tests. All
changes must pass all unit tests. You can run the tests by making sure that
the `nose` module and running:
    nose -w tests/unit/

For consistency's sake, use double quotes to delimit strings unless the strings
contain double quote characters.


Pull Request Guidelines:
- All pull requests should be a single commit, so that the changes can be observed
and evaluated together. Here's the best way to make that happen:
    - Pull from this repo's 'working' branch to your local repo. All pull requests
      *must* be against the 'working' branch.
    - Create a local branch for making your changes:
        - git checkout working
        - git checkout -b mychangebranch
    - Do all your testing, fixing, etc., in that branch. Make as many commits
      as you need as you work.
    - When you've completed your changes, and have added your unit tests and
      made sure that everything's working great, merge it back into working
      using the '--squash' option so that it appears as a single commit.
        - git checkout working
        - git merge --squash mychangebranch
        - git commit -am "Adds super powers to pyrax."
        - git push origin working
    - Now you have your changes in a single commit against your 'working'
      branch on GitHub, and can create the pull request.
