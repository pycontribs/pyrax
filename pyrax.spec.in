%description
A library for working with most OpenStack-based cloud deployments, though it
originally targeted the Rackspace public cloud. For example, the code for
cloudfiles contains the ability to publish your content on Rackspace's CDN
network, even though CDN support is not part of OpenStack Swift. But if you
don't use any of the CDN-related code, your app will work fine on any
standard Swift deployment.
