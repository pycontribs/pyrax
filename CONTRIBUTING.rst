Please submit an issue before submitting a pull request so we can determine
whether or not the change may be accepted. Pyrax is in the process of being
deprecated in favor of the OpenStack SDK. We will announce the process and
timelines for this deprecation as soon as we can.

Please set all pull requests to merge to the `master` branch as we are now
using `GitHub flow <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>`_ for development.

For style guidelines, please see the `HACKING <HACKING.rst>`_ document in the
root of this repository.

If you find any bugs, or have ideas for improving pyrax, please create an issue
at:

Thanks!
